## 9. Are they the same BSTs?

You are given two arrays which represent two sequences of keys that are used to create two binary search trees. Write a program that will tell whether the two BSTs will be identical or not without actually constructing the tree. You may use another data structure such as an array or a linked list but don't construct the BST. What is the time complexity of your algorithm? E.g., `3, 5, 4, 6, 1, 0, 2` and `3, 1, 5, 2, 4, 6, 0` are two sequences of arrays but will create the exact same BSTs and your program should return true.

  if (arr1.length !== arr2.length || arr1[0] !== arr2[0]) return false;
  if (arr1.length === 0 || arr2.length === 0) return true;

  const high1 = [];
  const high2 = [];
  const low1 = [];
  const low2 = [];

  for (let i = 1; i < arr1.length; i++) {
    if (arr1[i] > arr1[0]) {
      high1.push(arr1[i]);
    } else {
      low1.push(arr1[i]);
    }
  }

  for (let i = 1; i < arr2.length; i++) {
    if (arr2[i] > arr2[0]) {
      high2.push(arr2[i]);
    } else {
      low2.push(arr2[i]);
    }
  }

  return (
    checkBSTfromArray(high1, high2) && checkBSTfromArray(low1, low22)
  );
}

const arr1 = [3, 4, 4, 6, 1, 0, 2]
const arr2 = [3, 1, 5, 2, 4, 6, 0]


console.log(checkBSTfromArray(arr1, arr2), "are these arrays identical?")
