## 5. Height of a BST
Write an algorithm to find the height of a binary search tree. 

What is the time complexity of your algorithm?

  It depends, if it is a balanced binary search tree then the time complexity is logarithmic O(log(n)), if it is a skewed binary search tree the it will have a linear time of O(n)
