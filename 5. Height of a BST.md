## 5. Height of a BST
Write an algorithm to find the height of a binary search tree. 
```
function findBSTHeight(trees) {
  if (!trees) {
    return 0
  }
  if(!trees.left && !trees.right) {
    return 1
  }
  let height = 0
  if(trees.right) {
    let rightHeight = 1 + findBSTHeight(trees.right)
    if (rightHeight > height) height = rightHeight
  }
  if(trees.left) {
    let leftHeight = 1 + findBSTHeight(trees.left)
    if (leftHeight > height) height = leftHeight
  }
  return height
}

console.log(findBSTHeight(bst))
```

- What is the time complexity of your algorithm?
  - It depends, if it is a balanced binary search tree then the time complexity is logarithmic `O(log(n))`, if it is a skewed binary search tree the it will have a linear time of `O(n)`
